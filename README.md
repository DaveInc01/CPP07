# CPP MODULES

## Summary

This repository contains the modules of the C++ piscine from 42 School.

Each module is in a folder named `cppXX` where `XX` is the number of the module.

The higher the number, the more advanced the module is.

In all of these exercises, I have adhered to good coding practices, ensuring that my code is clean, readable, and efficient. All my code has been compiled using the `c++` compiler with the flags `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`, and it has been confirmed to compile with the `-std=c++98` flag as well.

## Module 07 - C++ Templates

The aim of this module was to explore and understand the concept of templates in C++. This module provided me with the essential knowledge to develop efficient and flexible code using templates, which is a powerful feature of C++.

The projects in this module ranged from simple function templates to more complex class templates. Through these projects, I gained a deep understanding of the power of templates in creating reusable code, which can work with different data types while ensuring type safety.

- **Function Templates:** In this exercise, I started with a few basic function templates to get a feel for the syntax and usage of templates in C++. I implemented function templates for common operations like min, max, and swap.
- **Iter:** Here, I created a function template named 'iter'. This function took three parameters: an array, the length of the array, and a function. The 'iter' function applied the passed function to each element of the array.
- **Array:** In this exercise, I implemented a class template named 'Array'. This class encapsulated an array of elements, where the type of the elements and the size of the array were template parameters. This class also implemented member functions for accessing and modifying array elements.
